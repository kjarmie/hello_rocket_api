## INTRODUCTION
This project is a simple starter API for my side projects. I intend to set this project up so that it can act as a base project for any future projects. 

This includes attaching a postgres database, a data-layer for handling database access, a library layer for abstracting database access. 

The next steps include setting up authentication with username/password, authorization with roles and permissions.
